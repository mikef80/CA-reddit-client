# Debugging Tips + Helpful Resources

Feeling stuck? Try the following:
- Google your question: oftentimes, someone has had the same question as you! Check out websites like StackOverflow and Quora to see how other folks have found solutions.
- Read the documentation: make sure to carefully read through the documentation for any languages and libraries that you are using. Oftentimes they’ll have examples of what you’re looking for!
- Rubber ducking: try to explain a problem to a friend or co-worker. Oftentimes you’ll figure out the solution as you’re trying to explain it. And if not, getting another pair of eyes on your code can be helpful.
