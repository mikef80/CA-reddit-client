## To Do

### Plan your project
- Visualize your end result. What is it built with? What can it do? Make sure that it satisfies all of the project objectives.
- Make a timeline for yourself and avoid the temptation to build things that aren’t required. Setting firm boundaries and deadlines will keep you on track and prevent
- The following tasks will help you identify natural break points.

### Wireframe your application
Using pencil and paper, or a wireframing software of your choice, draft what you’d like your application to look like.

### Create files and run it locally
On your computer, create the files needed for your React application. Run your application locally to see what it looks like in the browser.

### Version control
Set up the folder you created previously to be a Git repository. Push the initial files to a repository on GitHub. You should be consistently committing your changes throughout the project. Make sure to have meaningful commit messages.

### Build the components
Based on your wireframes, start building your application with fake, local data. Remember to build reusable components and to keep your components small.

Other things to keep in mind:
- Your application should work for all screen sizes
- You are welcome to use libraries to help you accomplish features
- You should write unit tests and end-to-end tests where it makes sense

### Add Reddit data
Connect your application to the Reddit API.

When interacting with the API, don’t forget to handle error states.

### Publish to the web
Congratulations on building your application! Deploy what you’ve built and share it with the world!
